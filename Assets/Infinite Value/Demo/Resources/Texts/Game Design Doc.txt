### My first game.docx

I've started learning Unity 2 weeks ago so I thought I would start with something simple.

My game will be a procedurally generated MMORPG with cross platform play, modifiable terrain and animated cinematics.
It will have support for modding, VR, AR and also feature a single player open world campaign.

I'm getting pretty good thanks to some youtube tutorials so it should be done in about a mongth.

BEST IDEA:
"A guy walks into a bar, the game"

### Most original idea ever.docx

My never seen concept of a game:
An electrician named Lorenzo has to save the princess Nectarine that got captured by Reswob, an evil snail with spikes on his shell.
Lorenzo is able to jump and can eat brussels sprouts to grow bigger. He can also pick up snowflakes that will grant him speed and invicibility for a few seconds.
The game will be divided into multiple zones that I've decided to call "levels" and the camera will be on the side.

Game clicker:

Serves as a demo for the Infinite Value asset.

The goal is to create as much games as possible.
You can create new game by typing a text, typing can be done by using any key on the keyboard.
Creating games give you money, you can use your money to buy upgrades or incomes that will generate games for you.

The demo will feature an import and export save system, and buttons to mute the sounds and music.

It will probably be the best demo ever created ;).
